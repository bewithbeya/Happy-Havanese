    <h1>The Havanese Dog Breed</h1>

    <img src="happy.jpg" alt="Havanese Dogs" class="left-img">

    <p>
      The Havanese is a small dog breed known for its friendly personality and affectionate
      nature. Originally bred as companion dogs, Havanese are highly social and enjoy being
      around people.
    </p>

    <p>
      This breed is recognized for its long, silky coat and expressive eyes. Although their
      appearance is elegant, Havanese dogs are playful, adaptable, and well suited for both
      families and individuals.
    </p>

    <p>
      Havanese dogs are intelligent and quick learners, which makes them easy to train. They
      thrive in environments where they receive regular mental stimulation and social
      interaction. Daily playtime and walks help keep them healthy and happy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Grooming is an important part of caring for a Havanese. Their long coats require regular
      brushing to prevent tangles and matting. Many owners also enjoy experimenting with
      different haircuts that suit their lifestyle while maintaining the breed’s natural charm.
    </p>

    <p>
      As this project develops, additional information can be added about the breed’s history,
      care routines, and personality traits. Havanese dogs make wonderful companions for
      both first-time dog owners and experienced families alike.
